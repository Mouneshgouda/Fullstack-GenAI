ChatGPT said:
Absolutely! Here's a complete step-by-step guide to setting up a CI/CD pipeline using only GitHub and Jenkins — no other tools (no Docker, no GitHub Actions, no cloud services like AWS/GCP).

✅ Requirements
On Your Jenkins Server (Self-hosted or VM):
Jenkins installed and running

Git plugin installed

Jenkins user has SSH access or credentials to GitHub (optional for cloning private repos)

🧱 Step 1: Prepare Your GitHub Repository
Create a new repository or choose an existing one.

Add your application code.

Optionally, add a basic Jenkinsfile for pipeline definition (we'll do freestyle first, then scripted).

⚙️ Step 2: Configure Jenkins
2.1: Install Necessary Plugins (Manage Jenkins > Plugin Manager)
Git Plugin ✅

Pipeline ✅

SSH Agent (optional if using SSH keys) ✅

2.2: Add GitHub Credentials (If private repo)
Go to: Manage Jenkins → Credentials → (global) → Add Credentials

Type: Username & Password or SSH Key

ID: github-creds (or any name you’ll use in job)

🚀 Step 3: Create a Freestyle Jenkins Job (Initial CI Setup)
Go to New Item → Freestyle Project → Name: my-project-ci

Under Source Code Management:

Git

Repo URL: https://github.com/your-user/your-repo.git (or use SSH URL)

Credentials: Choose the one you added

Under Build Triggers:

Check "Poll SCM" (e.g., H/5 * * * * to poll every 5 min)

Under Build:

Add build step: Execute shell

Example for a Java app:

bash
Copy
Edit
echo "Building..."
mvn clean install
Save and Build Now to test.

🔁 Step 4: Enable GitHub Webhook (Optional but Better Than Polling)
In GitHub:

Go to your repo → Settings → Webhooks → Add webhook

Payload URL: http://your-jenkins-url/github-webhook/

Content type: application/json

Events: Just push event

In Jenkins:

Go to job → Configure → Build Triggers

Check: "GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling"

🔧 Step 5: Switch to Pipeline Job (for CI/CD)
Create a new Pipeline job in Jenkins

Under Pipeline Definition:

Choose: Pipeline script from SCM

SCM: Git

Repo URL and credentials same as before

Script Path: Jenkinsfile

🧾 Step 6: Create a Jenkinsfile in Your Repo (CI/CD)
Example Jenkinsfile for a Java Maven app:

groovy
Copy
Edit
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git credentialsId: 'github-creds', url: 'https://github.com/your-user/your-repo.git'
            }
        }

        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean install'
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying to production...'
                // Add your custom deployment command here
            }
        }
    }
}
Push this Jenkinsfile to your repo.

✅ Done!
Now you have a complete CI/CD pipeline using only GitHub and Jenkins.

🧪 Optional Enhancements (Still only using Jenkins + GitHub):
Add post-build actions (e.g., email, archive artifacts)

Add parallel test stages

Create multi-branch pipelines if you're using branches

If you tell me what kind of project you have (Java, Node.js, Python, etc.), I can tailor the exact pipeline file to your tech stack. Want that?

No worries! Let's break it down step by step, very simply, assuming you're a beginner and only using GitHub and Jenkins.

🚀 Goal:
Create a CI/CD pipeline using only:

✅ GitHub (for code)

✅ Jenkins (for build and deploy)

❌ No Docker, No GitHub Actions, No Cloud

🧱 What You Need First
✅ 1. Jenkins Installed
On your computer or a server.
👉 Go to https://www.jenkins.io/download/ and install it.

✅ 2. GitHub Account
And a repository with your project code.

🔧 Step-by-Step Guide
🟢 Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
Go to https://github.com

Click "New Repository"

Give it a name like my-first-pipeline

Add a file like main.py or index.html or your app files

🟢 Step 2: Open Jenkins in your browser
Usually runs at: http://localhost:8080
(or your server IP: http://your-ip:8080)

🟢 Step 3: Create a Freestyle Project in Jenkins
On Jenkins dashboard → click “New Item”

Enter project name: my-first-job

Select “Freestyle project”

Click OK

🟢 Step 4: Link Your GitHub Repo to Jenkins
Scroll to Source Code Management

Select Git

Paste your GitHub repo URL:
Example:

perl
Copy
Edit
https://github.com/your-username/my-first-pipeline.git
If your repo is private, click Add Credentials and add GitHub username + token

🟢 Step 5: Add Build Steps
Scroll to Build

Click “Add build step” → “Execute shell”

Example: If your repo has a simple Python script:

bash
Copy
Edit
echo "Running my app"
python3 main.py
🟢 Step 6: Save and Run
Click Save

On left sidebar, click “Build Now”

Go to Console Output to see what happened

🟡 (Optional) Step 7: Trigger Build Automatically
Using Webhook:
In GitHub:

Go to Settings → Webhooks → Add Webhook

URL: http://your-jenkins-ip:8080/github-webhook/

Select “Just the push event”

Click Add Webhook

In Jenkins job:

Go to Configure → Build Triggers

Check ✅ "GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling"

Now Jenkins runs automatically when you push code to GitHub!

✅ Done!
You've now set up CI/CD using only GitHub and Jenkins. 🎉
Every time you push code → Jenkins pulls it → builds it → runs it.

Need Help With a Specific Project?
Tell me:

What language? (Python, Java, Node.js…)

What should happen after code is built? (Deploy somewhere?)

Then I can give you exact code for Jenkins.

Great! Let's focus on Step 4: Link Your GitHub Repo to Jenkins — I’ll walk you through it slowly and clearly.

🎯 GOAL of Step 4:
Make Jenkins pull your code from GitHub when building your project.

📝 What You Need First:
A GitHub repository with code (public or private).

Your Jenkins is up and running.

Jenkins has Git plugin installed (you can check this in: Manage Jenkins → Plugin Manager → Installed → Search "Git").

🔧 Step-by-Step: Link GitHub to Jenkins Freestyle Job
✅ A. Go to Your Jenkins Job
Open Jenkins in browser (http://localhost:8080 or your server IP).

Click on your Jenkins job (or create one: New Item → Freestyle Project).

Click "Configure" on the left side.

✅ B. Configure Git in Jenkins
Scroll down to "Source Code Management" section.

Select Git (default is "None").

In Repository URL, paste your GitHub repo URL:

🔹 Example for a Public Repo:
arduino
Copy
Edit
https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
🔒 If your repo is Private, you also need to:
Click "Add" (next to "Credentials")

Choose:

Username + Password (or Personal Access Token)
OR

SSH key

Click "Add", then choose it from the dropdown next to the URL

✅ C. Choose a Branch (optional)
In "Branches to build", leave as:

bash
Copy
Edit
*/main
(if your main branch is named main)
Or set to */master or another branch name.

✅ D. Save Your Job
Click "Save" at the bottom.

Now Jenkins is connected to your GitHub repo!

✅ E. Test the Connection
On the job page, click “Build Now”

Click on the build number → Console Output

You should see Jenkins cloning your GitHub repo, like:

nginx
Copy
Edit
Cloning repository https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
💡 If You Get Errors
Make sure the GitHub URL is correct.

If it's private, make sure credentials are added.

Jenkins server must have internet access to reach GitHub.

✅ Step 4 is Complete!
Now Jenkins can pull your code from GitHub.

Would you like help doing this with screenshots or using a specific type of project (e.g., Python, Node.js)?

 github or jenkin credintioal like username or password??


ChatGPT said:
Great question! Let’s clear it up simply.

🔐 If Your GitHub Repo is Private, Jenkins needs permission to access it.
You have 2 main options:
✅ Option 1: Use GitHub Username + Personal Access Token (PAT)
🔹 What to use in Jenkins Credentials:
Username → Your GitHub username

Password → Your GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)

❗ NOT your GitHub password — GitHub no longer allows that!

🛠 How to get a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT):
Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens

Click "Generate new token"

Use token (classic) unless using fine-grained tokens

Set scopes:

✅ repo (for private repo access)

✅ read:user (optional)

Generate → Copy the token

🔐 In Jenkins:
Go to your Jenkins job → Configure

In Source Code Management → Git:

Click “Add” next to "Credentials"

Choose:

Kind: Username with password

Username: your GitHub username

Password: paste your GitHub token

Click Add, then select it from the dropdown

✅ Option 2: Use SSH Key
This works if:

You already use SSH to clone GitHub repos

Jenkins machine has a private SSH key that GitHub knows

Steps:
On Jenkins:

Use a key pair in /home/jenkins/.ssh/id_rsa (private key)

On GitHub:

Go to https://github.com/settings/keys

Click "New SSH Key"

Paste the public key (from id_rsa.pub)

In Jenkins:

Credentials → Add → Kind: SSH Username with private key

Username: usually git

Private Key: paste contents of id_rsa

```
